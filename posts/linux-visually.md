I've been doing CyberPatriot for a while. Over the years, I've accumulated quite a bit of Linux knowledge and resources. Now, I want to help ==you== improve your own skills. I feel like we learn best with visuals and examples, so I'm creating a video series to break down and conceptually explain complex Linux topics. Check it out on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcn9NsWbb8s4wQrX0Qi5G4kRifQHxCV9-) and let me know what you think. More videos are on the way!
