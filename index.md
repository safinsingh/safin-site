  <h1>Hello, I'm Safin</h1>
</div>

I'm an Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) student at UC Berkeley interested in computer systems and mathematics. I'm currently working on RISC-V SoC simulation tooling as an Undergraduate Researcher at the [Berkeley SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

<br>

I enjoy challenging myself with difficult problems (`homework due yesterday` and `debugging Rust errors`, to name a few). In doing so, I've developed an aptitude for learning new things and simplifying their core concepts to <a href="/posts/linux-visually/" target="_self">teach them to others</a>.

<br>

I love to build low-level \*nix apps, security training tools, websites—and just about everything in between. I primarily write code in Rust, C, and Python. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7isCii8IZOBPInAYFn2n5Q).
