  <h1>Hi, I'm Safin</h1>

<div class="content mb-20">

I'm studying EE & CS at UC Berkeley and I'm curious about everything from ==silicon and systems== to ==software and statistics==. My current work focuses on modeling core mechanisms of Linux's `sched_ext` framework to evaluate correctness invariants of experimental scheduling policies in the [Berkeley NetSys Lab](https://netsys.cs.berkeley.edu).

I enjoy challenging myself with difficult problems (==homework due yesterday== and ==debugging Rust errors==, to name a few). In doing so, I've developed an aptitude for learning new things and simplifying their core concepts to <a href="/posts/linux-visually/" target="_self">teach them to others</a>. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7isCii8IZOBPInAYFn2n5Q).
